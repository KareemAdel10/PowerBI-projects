# Power BI Project Documentation: Data Roles Survey Analysis
------
## Project Overview
- This project analyzes the "Data Roles Survey" dataset, collected by the YouTube channel "Alex The Analyst." The goal is to clean, transform, and analyze the data to gain insights into various data roles.

## Dataset Description
- Source: "Alex The Analyst" YouTube channel
- Name: Data Roles Survey
- Description: Survey data from individuals in different data-related roles, including job titles, salaries, skills, and more.

## Power Query Transformations
- Salary Bins: Converted salary ranges into salary averages for better analysis (e.g., "$50,000-$100,000" to 75000).
- Deleting Empty Columns: Removed columns with little or no data to focus on relevant information.
- Handling Categorical Data: Split columns without an "Others" option into multiple binary columns for each category.
- Data Consistency: Standardized various values for uniformity (e.g., different job title spellings, skill representations).
- Other Cleaning Steps: Managed missing values and created new columns for additional insights.
